\section{Experiments}\label{sec:exp}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
We have used the Frames dataset \cite{frames} as 
our benchmark. Containing 1369 chats between 
a chatbot and users interested in booking a vacations, 
it consists the entire chats along with its semantic features. 
Each chat is assigned a tag of 1 if the user has booked a vacation 
in the chat and 0 otherwise. 

Since originally this dataset was not created for the dialog-ending problem, 
we had tagged all chats automatically, using a other features that exist 
in the dataset, namely sentences that include a ``book'' action. 

We have divided the dataset into 1000 training chats and 300 test chats.

Starting from the word embeddings, we have used the 
NKTK package \cite{DBLP:conf/acl/Bird06} and the already trained network Glove \cite{DBLP:conf/emnlp/PenningtonSM14} 
to embed the words in each sentence to vectors using the the Keras package \cite{chollet2015}. 
We then use Keras to build our hierarchal network, train it and test it on the 
dataset, with the exception of the attention layers applied on both the word and sentence 
levels, implementing the concept presented in \cite{DBLP:conf/naacl/YangYDHSH16,tc}.
